🛍️ Product Recommendation Website
A simple, responsive Product Recommendation Website that helps users discover products based on their interests, preferences, or browsing behavior. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fast, lightweight performance and easy customization.

🌟 Features
🎯 Personalized product suggestions

🔍 Search and filter by category, price, or rating

🖼️ Clean UI with product images, descriptions, and reviews

🛠️ How It Works
Products are either hardcoded in HTML or dynamically loaded from a JSON file.

JavaScript handles filtering, search, and user interaction.

Recommendations can be:

Predefined by category

Randomized

Based on simulated "user preference" logic

✏️ Customization
Add your own products to products.json or directly in HTML.

Modify style.css to change colors, fonts, layout.

Use script.js to implement recommendation logic or integrate with a backend or API.

📈 Advanced Ideas (Optional)
Connect to a real database (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB Atlas)

Add user login and history-based recommendations

Integrate a recommendation engine using ML (e.g., content-based filtering)

Include user ratings, reviews, and wishlist features
